📖 **Project Overview**

This Digital Twin prototype simulates a remote sensor monitoring system using mock data, offering a practical demonstration of IoT-enabled system surveillance. It shows how virtual representations of physical devices can be created, monitored, and visualized through an intuitive web interface.

---

🏗️ **Architecture**

The solution consists of:

* **Mock Data Generator** – Simulates sensor telemetry for demonstration purposes.
* **React Frontend** – Displays telemetry data such as speed, temperature, fuel level, and GPS location.
* **Backend ** – Serves data or acts as a proxy to a real IoT context broker.
* **Visualization** – Maps and gauges to represent live sensor states.

Communication happens over HTTP REST APIs; real IoT integration can replace mock data in the future.

💡 **Technologies Used**

* React.js (functional components, hooks)
* Material-UI / Chakra UI for responsive UI components
* Node.js / Express 
* Mock data for sensor simulation
